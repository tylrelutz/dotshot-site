  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="small">Last updated: September 14, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how DotShot ("we," "our," or "us") handles information when you use our mobile game.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you use DotShot, we may collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>App performance and crash data</strong> – such as device type, operating system, and error logs.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage analytics</strong> – information about how the game is used (for example, levels played or features accessed).</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase information</strong> – details related to in-app purchases, such as the product purchased and transaction date.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not collect your name, email, phone number, or other personal contact information within the app.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Operate and improve the game.</li>
    <li>Understand gameplay patterns so we can make better design decisions.</li>
    <li>Process and confirm in-app purchases.</li>
    <li>Fix crashes, bugs, and technical issues.</li>
    <li>Provide customer support if you contact us directly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>We may share limited information with service providers that help us deliver the game (for example, app store platforms that process purchases, or analytics providers that help us understand performance). These providers are bound by their own privacy policies.</p>
  <p>We do not sell your information to third parties for advertising or marketing.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We keep information only as long as necessary to operate the game, comply with legal obligations, or resolve disputes. After that, data is securely deleted or anonymized.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>DotShot is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us information, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about your data, you can contact us at any time. Depending on your region, you may have rights to request access, correction, or deletion of certain information.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the game after updates means you accept the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
  <p>Email: <a href="mailto:hello@purrfectly.app">hello@purrfectly.app</a></p>
